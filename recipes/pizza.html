            <li>670g Filtered Water</li>
            <li>20g Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>15g High-Quality Olive Oil</li>
            <li>20g Honey</li>

            <li>Fresh Basil</li>

        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat your water to 95 degrees and add your yeast & honey. Let this sit for 5-10 minutes or until foamy.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, add your flour, salt, and olive oil, mixing to combine.</li>
            <li>While mixing with the dough hook attachment, add in your yeast mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix on low speed for 10-15 minutes or until your dough forms a smooth, tight ball. You may need to knead by hand to get it to the texture you want.</li>
            <li>Once kneaded, grease the bowl with olive oil, add your dough ball back, and cover with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Put that bowl in the fridge and let it proof overnight until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Remove your dough from the fridge, punch it down, and separate into 5 or 6 dough balls that are roughly 250g each.</li>
            <li>Lay these on a baking sheet and cover with a damp towel to proof for 45 minutes to an hour or until doubled in size. Preheat your pizza oven to at least 750 degrees whil these proof.</li>
            <li>Press down one of your dough balls and stretch it into a 12-14 inch round. Place that on a heavily floured pizza peel.</li>
            <li>To that round, add your sauce, mozarella, and any other toppings you desire and quickly toss that in your oven.</li>
            <li>Rotate your pizza every 20-30 seconds until the cheese is melted and your crust is golden brown with some light charring.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and top with salt, black pepper, italian seasoning, and a few leaves of fresh Basil.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the rest of your dough balls.</li>
        </ol>
