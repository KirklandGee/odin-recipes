    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These are the kind of pancakes your southern grandma would make. Simple, easy, but also BOMB.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Self-Rising Flour</li>
        <li>200g Buttermlik</li>
        <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>20g Maple Syrup</li>
        <li>10g Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Butter for cooking & syrup for finishing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a griddle or cast iron skillet to medium heat</li>
        <li>In a large pyrex measuring cup, whisk your eggs, buttermilk, maple syrup, and salt until combined</li>
        <li>Add in your flower, folding slowly with a spatula until just combined and lumpy.
            The texture should be pretty thick, almost too thick to pour, but not quite.
        </li>
        <li>Throw some butter in your pan until foamy and pour your batter in large rounds, as big as 3-5 inches in diameter.
            If you have other fillings like blueberries or chocolate chips, sprinkle them in now, once the pancake is on the griddle.
        </li>
        <li>Cook until you see the sides starting to cook and bubbles forming on top, and then flip, cooking both sides until golden brown and cooked through</li>
        <li>Top with a little extra butter and maple syrup, and you're good to go!</li>
    </ol>
