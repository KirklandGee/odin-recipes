    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        These are some of the best cookies you'll have in your life. They are gooey, crispy, and oh-so delicious.
        You'll need a little extra time to make them, but I promise they're worth it. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>225g Unsalted Butter (2 Sticks)</li>
        <li>280g All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>3g Baking Soda</li>
        <li>4g Kosher Salte</li>
        <li>140g White Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>140g Dark Brown Sugar</li>
        <li>2 Large Eggs (100g)</li>
        <li>10ml Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>110g Semisweet Chocolate Chips</li>
        <li>115g 72% Dark Chocolate Bar, rough chopped (Ghiradelli, if you can find it)</li>
        <li>Maldon Flaky Salt for finishing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together your flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl, and add your your white sugar, eggs, and vanilla to the bowl of a stand mixer.
            Whisk that mixture until it falls off the whisk in thick ribbons (around 5 minutes)
        </li>
        <li>Melt your butter in a pan or on the microwave until fully liquid. Let that cool to room temp and, using the paddle attachment, mix that into your egg & sugar mixture
            along with your dark brown sugar.
        </li>
        <li>Now add in your flour mixture and mix on low until just barelu combined. There should be some dry flour left.</li>
        <li>Add your chocolate chips and chopped dark chocolate to your mixture and fold in with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Place your dough in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap, at least overnight and up to 72 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready, preheat your oven to 325F and scoop out your cold cookie dough with a big ice cream scoop onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.
            You shouldn't be able to fit more than 6-8 cookies per sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Bake until golden brown but still gooey in the middle, around 13-16 minutes, rotating your pans around and back-to-front halfway through</li>
        <li>Once removed from the oven, sprinkle with Maldon Flaky Salt and gently press down to get the salt stuck in the top of the cookie, and transfer to a wire rack to cool.</li>
    </ol>
